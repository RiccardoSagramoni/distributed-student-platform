This page shows the details of a course.

It also provides buttons to access the corresponding chatroom and book a meeting with the professor.

Moreover, it is possible for a student to star the course, so that it can be shown in a separate section on their own portal page. When a student clicks on the button \textit{Start this course}, an alert pop-up spawns to notify the success of the request. The same pattern applies for the removal of a star (\textit{unstar}).
