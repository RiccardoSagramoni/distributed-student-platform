Student University Platform is a distributed web-app aimed at providing various functionalities to students and professors, which are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item allow booking and managing of meetings
    \item provide chatroom functionality among students where they can share opinions and suggestions
\end{itemize}
Both students and professors have a dedicated page where they can view scheduled meetings and cancel them. Within the course page, on the other hand, it is possible to access the dedicated chatroom or look at the list of available slots and choose the meeting to reserve.
